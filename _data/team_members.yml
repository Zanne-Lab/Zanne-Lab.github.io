  education1: I am interested in the evolution and community ecology of insects, especially termites. I love learning about the role that termites play in decomposition and carbon cycling. I am also interested in urban ecology and the ways that insects adapt to living in cities.

  education1: By developing novel carbon flux systems, I hope to understand short- and long-term changes to carbon cycling in urban systems, patchy ecosystems and marine-terrestrial interfaces. It is especially important to understand carbon cycling across marine-terrestrial gradients, as these areas are seeing some of the most intense environmental changes and disturbances.

  education1: I am interested in understanding key factors that control organic matter decomposition, with a focus in fine scale variables such as litter quality and microclimatic conditions. I am also interested in understanding potential plant-soil feedback mechanisms related to organic matter decomposition, and how these feedback mechanisms can influence plant community dynamics. These questions are particularly focused in the Brazilian Cerrados Biome, where I investigate if plant-soil feedbacks influence the savanna-forest transition dynamics.

  education1: I am interested in how carbon is stored and released from terrestrial ecosystems, particularly focusing on how decomposition releases C in different rates and forms. I am also interested in the role that termites play in deomposition rates in different habitats. 
  education2: Favorite species? Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) - the tree that makes for both the most magical sights and sounds!
  education3: Favorite thing to cook or bake? Vegan banana bread (the more bananas and chocolate chips, the better)
