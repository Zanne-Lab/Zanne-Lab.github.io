  education1: I am interested in the evolution and community ecology of insects, especially termites. I love learning about the role that termites play in decomposition and carbon cycling. I am also interested in urban ecology and the ways that insects adapt to living in cities.

  education1: Knowing the rates in which carbon flows in and out of natural ecosystems and urban environments is more important than ever. It is especially difficult to understand carbon cycling across marine-terrestrial gradients, as these areas are seeing some of the most intense environmental changes and disturbances. By developing novel carbon flux systems, I hope to understand short- and long-term changes to carbon cycling in urban systems, patchy ecosystems and marine-terrestrial interfaces.

  education1: I am interested in understanding key factors that control organic matter decomposition, with a focus in fine scale variables such as litter quality and microclimatic conditions. I am also interested in understanding potential plant-soil feedback mechanisms related to organic matter decomposition, and how these feedback mechanisms can influence plant community dynamics. These questions are particularly focused in the Brazilian Cerrados Biome, where I investigate if plant-soil feedbacks influence the savanna-forest transition dynamics.

  education1: I am interested in how carbon is stored and released from terrestrial ecosystems, particularly focusing on how decomposition releases C in different rates and forms. I am also interested in the role that termites play in deomposition rates in different habitats.
