# Open positions

We are always looking for undergraduate and graduate students to join our ecology and evolution research group! Many in our group are exploring how plant construction influences community structure and function (from morphology to genes and transcripts) of biotic decay agents (e.g., microbes and termites), and the consequences of these interactions for the forest carbon cycle as climate changes. Other lab projects include exploring microbiota assembly on leaves and fruits, and using global functional trait databases to explore ecology and evolution of fungi and plants.

The student would join an interactive lab group that broadly focuses on plant, microbe and termite structure and function (anatomy and physiological ecology), community ecology, and evolutionary ecology in both temperate and tropical areas. Field projects are currently primarily based in the US, Australia, and France. The graduate work will be completed at George Washington University, which is located in the heart of DC, with easy access to numerous science, conservation, and policy based institutions, such as the Smithsonian.

### Applications for PhD students
If you are interested in doing graduate work with us, please send an email to me (Amy Zanne: aezanne@gmail.com) with brief details about your GPA, GRE, research interests, experience, and why you want to go to graduate school. For information about applying to the program, go to the George Washington University Department of Biological Sciences website. The application deadline is early December. I am also happy to answer any questions you might have. For undergraduates, please send me brief details about your GPA, research interests, experience, and what you hope to do in the future.

For graduate students, we encourage you to take a look at the [NSF-GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) for external funding sources.

### George Washington University undergraduate students
If you are an undergraduate student at George Washington University looking for research experience, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office. We would love to learn about what interests your in biology, and how we can help you grow! 

Additionally, George Washington biology undergraduates have the opportunity to pursue a combined Bs/Ms program. Qualified students may pursue the combined degree program to complete a Bachelor of Science in Biology and Master of Science in Biology within five years. The accelerated program allows students to complete some graduate credits as part of their undergraduate program. If you are interested in pursuing this with our lab, please reach out via email (Amy Zanne: aezanne@gmail.com).
