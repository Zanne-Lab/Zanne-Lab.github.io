# Open positions

**Note: We currently don't have funding for additional PhD and postdoc positions. We can only welcome you if you have a fellowship. I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [NSF-GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) for external funding sources.

NOTE - this is how to embed a PDF [here is last years call]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/h2020-wp1820-msca_en.pdf)).**



### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:aezanne@gmail.com). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.



### Master projects for George Washington University students
